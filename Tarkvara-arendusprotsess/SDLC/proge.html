        1. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):<br />
        <br />
        It is a software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance experts, and customer representatives in a software project.<br />
        It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.<br />
        <br />
        2. Design-Driven Development:<br />
        <br />
        Design-driven development (DDD) places design at the forefront of product creation.<br />
        Rather than treating design as a mere aesthetic afterthought, DDD emphasizes its pivotal role in dictating the direction and functionality of software.<br />
        <br />
        3. Domain-Driven Design (DDD):<br />
        <br />
        Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach, focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.<br />
        Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. <br />
        For example: if software processes loan applications, it might have classes like "loan application", "customers", and methods such as "accept offer" and "withdraw".<br />
        <br />
        4. Secure by Design:<br />
        <br />
        Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.<br />
        Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design,<br />
        and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers.<br />
        It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even though those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind.<br />
        <br />
        5. Test-Driven Development (TDD):<br />
        <br />
        Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code.<br />
        It offers several advantages: Comprehensive Test Coverage: TDD ensures that all new code is covered by at least one test, leading to more robust software.<br />
        <br />
        6. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD):<br />
        <br />
        Analogous to test-driven development, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)<br />
        involves team members with different perspectives (customer, development, testing)<br />
        collaborating to write acceptance tests in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality.<br />
        <br />
        7. Continuous Test-Driven Development (CTDD):<br />
        <br />
        Continuous test-driven development (CTDD) is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.<br />
        <br />

        8. Specification by Example:<br />
        <br />
        Specification by example (SBE) is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements.<br />
        <br />
        9. Data-Driven Development:<br />
        <br />
        Data-driven software development is based on solid metrics like Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or Objectives And Key Results (OKRs).<br />
        Clear, objective, and unambiguous, these metrics encourage dev teams to think about the long-term strategic objectives of their day-to-day work and the business value of each project.<br />
        <br />

        10. Data-Oriented Design:<br />
        <br />
        Data-oriented design is a software design approach that focuses on organizing data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate.<br />
        It is based on the idea that data should be the primary focus of a program, rather than the operations or transformations performed on that data.<br />

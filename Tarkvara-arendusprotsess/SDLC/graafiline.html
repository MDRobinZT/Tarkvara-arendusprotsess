    <h1>Lower CASE</h1>

    <p>
        Lower CASE tools are designed for the back-end of the SDLC and are used for detailed systems design, system implementation and system support.<br />
        The most common Lower CASE tools are the code generators, but others include compilers and test support tools.<br />
